The Rainbow Connection

Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
And what's on the other side,
Rainbows have visions,
And never illusions,
And rainbows have nothing to hide.
And rainbows are beautiful. 
Having seven different veautiful colours
So we've been told,
And some choose to believe it,
One day the songs we might see,
Some day we'll find it,
The rainbow connection,
The lovers, the dreamers and me.

Who said that every wish,
Would be heard and answered,
When wished on a morning star,
Somebody thought of that,
And someone believed it,
And look what it's done so far.
